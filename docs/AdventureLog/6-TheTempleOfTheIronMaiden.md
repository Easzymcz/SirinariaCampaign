We arrive at the Temple of the Iron Maiden and hear a commotion inside.  Upon entering, we see an armored priest and his acolytes doing battle with giant vermin and a dimensional portal open over the dias.  We help the priest (Willis) clean the room, then he implores us to enter the portal and find a way to close it.  We go to enter the portal and witness Grimnir enter it first, then discharge an energy shield from it, becoming a ghostly version of himself trapped between worlds.  So naturally we jump right in.
