The players meet Hard Luck Ceonre and are informed that the individual goblin bands that infest the nearby woods are joining forces under the banner of a Hobgoblin. They must be stopped now before they become too much of a problem.

The players attempt to penetrate the goblin camps but find that the problem has escalated beyond what they can handle on their own. They then flee back to Hawksmont to gather more strength.

You are enjoying your newfound appreciation for helping with the recent spate of undead and and amateur necromancy in Browold’s Tavern, when the front door slams open. Through the door walks a familiar face. Known to the people of Hawksmont as Hard Luck Ceonre. This ranger is a frequent visitor of the tavern. He will drink and gamble until his money runs out and he is evicted by one of the Browolds, usually after he has had a drink or two that he cannot pay for, then disappear back into the surrounding forest for days, weeks, or even months at a time. Then returning once again with valuable supplies and information that can only be found in the deep woods. Ceonre dresses in all black except for his boots, which are brown but maybe would be black if they weren’t caked in mud. His hair hangs down the back of his cloak in long tangled mass of dreads. He has a long nose and brown eyes. He also has a hawk perched upon his shoulder. When he enters, the room is filled with smoke from one of his signature hand-rolled cigarettes. At the moment, though, his most defining characteristic is a small arrow, clearly of goblin make, protruding from his back.
“Someone is organizing the goblin bands. Most likely this big ol’ hobin they is callin’ Mauhak.”
Hard Luck takes a seat and orders a beer.
“Harvill, how ‘bout a beer, and none of that watered-down shit. I’ve had me a rough day.”

The Party agrees to help Ceorne and heads into the forest and to the area of the attack, where they find the remains of a battle between 2 different bands of goblins. Tracking the remains of the winning goblin band, the Party takes out one scout and captures another.
Ceonre interrogates the captive goblin, while Liara climbs a tree to scout for the rest of the goblins. From these two actions, the Party learns that someone or something is gathering the warring factions of goblins into an army that could threaten the safety of Hawksmont and other small towns in the forest.
Ambushed and overpowered by an owlbear, the Party retreats back to town. With this news in hand, Hawksmont asked the Party to travel to Greegate to ask for military assistance in combating the growing goblin threat.
Rumor: Greegate may be ruled by a 25,000 year old vampire
Rumor: Greegate has a 3-strikes rule on crime.  Execution is the penalty for 3 strikes.
Rumor: Weather is worse to the North & especially West.  There’s a ring of mountains to the West with a perpetual storm similar to the one on Jupiter.
