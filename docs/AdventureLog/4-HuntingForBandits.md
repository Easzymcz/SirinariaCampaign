title: Hunting For Bandits
chapter: 4

---
We enter a cave guarded by two city guards, fight past some trope (darkmantles, giant rat, bats, centipedes), and find a trapped chest.  We disarm the chest and loot the trap (a glass arrow with an acid vial attached - later destroyed in The Book That Almost Killed Us).  We then hit repeated traps that affect Liara and rest before pressing on.


Next, we encounter some Kobolds and Iver convinces them that we are minstrels (and support personnel) and that we need to find the bandits so that we can give them a very special BIRTHDAY SURPRISE.  They buy it and lead us straight to the bandit lair, bypassing all of the traps on the way.

We meet the “bandits”...and a baby.  Learn that they are from an order of  Vampire Hunters investigating Lord Greegate, and we leave them to their business.
