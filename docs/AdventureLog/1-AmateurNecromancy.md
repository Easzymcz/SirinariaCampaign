You are midway through summer in Hawksmont. The days have been unusually hot even for it being mid-summer. A gentle breeze provides very little respite from the heat and instead just feels like hot air against your sticky sweat-soaked skin. Cicada and other warm-weather insects buzz incessantly. Heat waves like this are the kind that can bring a village like this to ruin. The only saving grace is heavy rain from the West that seems to arrive like clockwork every third night. These storms are fierce and bring winds strong enough to blow down a man or a poorly constructed home. It's hard to say really for sure whether it's true but some villagers believe that each storm is worse than the last. The winds and hard driving rain make going outdoors a danger and travel nearly impossible. Without them refilling the rapidly depleting wells on a regular basis though there is no doubt that Hawksmont would not survive the daytime heat.

As a welcome night falls on a particularly hot day. You are winding down in Browold Tavern. Villagers take turns singing bawdy songs and enjoying relatively cool and cheap watered down beer from Browold's cellars. Spirits are high despite such a miserable summer. The party drinks for a while.

You hear the church bell ring. It is a constant ringing that signifies a warning usually an attack on the village. More often than not these are small marauding bands of goblins. The surrounding forest is rife with them and they are a constant threat.

You leave the drinking hole out onto the yard between the church and the tavern. You are greeted by what looks like 4 raggedly dressed men. They are unarmed but something about them is unsettling. Perhaps it is the glowing violet light emanating from their empty eye sockets. When they see you they attack!

We fight them, and see a purple light fly into the graveyard when we defeat one. The last one, we see a spectral form in the graveyard crying and we talked to her. She told us that her husband was keeping her body animated and that her soul was not able to rest because of that. She told us how to find his house. We go to the house to confront him about it, we saw the body being animated, he gave in pretty easily after we told him that he was hurting his wife by keeping her body animated, Ilia required that he burn all his books on necromancy, and he gave us letters to deliver to his sons because they were very angry with him and left on bad terms.
