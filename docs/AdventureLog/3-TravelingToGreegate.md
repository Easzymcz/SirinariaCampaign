Introduction: Before traveling to Greegate the Party is given a donkey and some trade goods.l 
	Part 1 - The Fey’s Babydaddy
	Ceonre travels with the Party to Greegate the next morning with the captive goblin as a witness. Suddenly, Ceonre panics and runs away. Before the Party could ask questions, they find themselves transported to a fey realm. There we meet Nimrode, the guardian fairy of the forest, who asks for her husband Ceonre, father of her unborn child. Having just lost Ceonre, the Party cannot help the fairy. Nimrode then says there will be consequences if her lost husband is not found…
	Part 2 - A Bridge Toll
The party comes to a bridge close to the outer walls of Greegate, where a band of thugs put up a toll. They claim to be city guards - thus this toll would be legal. Ilia argues with the leader about proper identification until Ilia fully regales the thugs with the story so far. The thugs are awe-struct, noticing the captive goblin, and just let the Party pass.
	Part 3 - A Grave Encounter
Traveling through the night, the Party comes up to a solitary cloaked figure. when the Party comes close, a Grave Owl and its undead thrall attack. Grimnir shoots down the owl with his bow before it’s undead champion could start its attack.

An inspection of the undead corpse reveals it to be a corpse of a noble of Greegate. We find a pendant and +7 magic longsword bearing the families royal seal.
	Part 4 - Arrival at Greegate
Upon arrival, Ilia returns the the dead noble’s gear to the family, The Noble’s show visible disdain for “commoners” and present the party with a pouch with 2 gold coins.

We hear the sound of a woman screaming coming from an alley.  We rush down the alley to find Phaegan’s House of Dentistry, where the screams are coming from.  ...

The Party meets with Lord Arito Greegate, the (vampire) ruler of Greegate.  We tell him about the goblin warbands threatening our village and he informs us that the village is outside of his jurisdiction, but that if we do a favor for him he will help us.  He tasks us with eliminating some bandits in a cave just outside of town.
