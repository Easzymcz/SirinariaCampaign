# House Rules

## Pending Approval
Our game is a democracy so the following rules are under consideration but have not yet been implemented in our game.
### New Feat Tree
* Use the feat tree from the [Elephant in the Room document](http://michaeliantorno.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/The-Elephant-in-the-Room-Feat-Taxes-in-Pathfinder.pdf)
### Simplified initiative
* Monsters roll first, players do not role initiative amongst themselves, instead their roll simply determines if they take their actions before or after the monsters.
* Another option for this is to roll every round for more dynamic combat.
### Usage dice
* Most items that are expendable have usage dice instead of a specific quantity.
* I think we've pretty much decided that we like this, it is just a matter of deciding and agreeing what this should apply to.

## Rules in play
I will expand on this later.
